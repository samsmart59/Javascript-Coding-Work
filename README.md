# Javascript-Coding-Work

A small project exercising the fundamentals of the JavaScript programming language.

To make this project work, you will need Node.js installed. 

Alternatively, you can use the built-in terminal on VS Code.

In VS code, navigate to Terminal and click the drop down icon next to the '+' sign.

Select 'Command Prompt' and type node script.js into the terminal.
 
You should expect to see a paragraph telling you a bit about myself.
